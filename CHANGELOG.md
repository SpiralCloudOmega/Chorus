# Changelog

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Ship-time code-review gateway**: A new read-only `code-reviewer` agent runs as the final AI-DLC gateway — after the last task of an idea-rooted proposal is verified, it reviews the idea's *aggregate* code change (cross-task integration, architecture consistency, security, regression, feature-level coverage) and posts one VERDICT comment on the idea. Advisory/behavioral like the proposal/task reviewers (it never changes the idea's stored status). Wired across all four plugin surfaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, standalone); the `on-post-verify-task.sh` hook gains a last-task-verify branch gated by `enableCodeReviewer` (default on) and bounded by `maxCodeReviewRounds` (default 3). Workflow skills document the gateway and the FAIL → quick-dev fix-task loop. (#350)
- **Copy session ID in daemon chat**: The daemon chat transcript header gains a "Copy session ID" button that copies the bare `claude --resume` anchor so a human can take a conversation over locally. Works for both idea-anchored and ad-hoc sessions; icon-only on mobile, icon + label on desktop, with accessible copy confirmation. (#348)

### Changed
- **Online agents rank first in @-mention candidates**: `searchMentionables` now enriches → sorts → slices (previously sliced before computing liveness, so a flood of matching users could cut online agents out before they were known to be online). Online agents sort ahead of offline agents and users, idle-first among online agents. Pure server-side; both `GET /api/mentionables` and the MCP `chorus_search_mentionables` benefit. (#349)
- **Project description renders as collapsible markdown**: The dashboard project description now renders through the Streamdown markdown pipeline (previously a plain `<p>`) and clamps to a fixed height with a Show more / Show less toggle. Clamping is by rendered height (not char-slicing) so markdown is never cut mid-token; the toggle only appears on actual overflow. (#351)

### Plugin
- **All plugin packages → 0.11.1**: Lockstep bump across Claude Code (marketplace.json + plugin.json), Codex, OpenClaw, every skill `SKILL.md` on all four surfaces, and the standalone `public/skill/` distribution — carrying the code-review gateway. (#350)

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Chorus Daemon — run your local Claude Code as a Chorus agent**: A new `chorus daemon` CLI client mode (plus `chorus login`) authenticates as an agent, subscribes to the notification SSE stream, and on each wake (task assigned / @mention / elaboration / human instruction) spawns a local headless `claude -p` wired to the Chorus MCP server. No new npm deps (headless subprocess, not the Agent SDK; cross-platform). Sessions are deterministically anchored on the dispatched entity's **direct idea uuid** — humans can take over any run with `claude --resume <idea-uuid>`, and a WakeQueue serializes per-anchor so two wakes never resume the same session at once. A headless guard forbids `AskUserQuestion` and routes human-decision points back to Chorus. Ships with TTY credential completion, default-yolo posture (`--chorus-only` for restricted), a startup banner, per-wake lifecycle logs, and `-d` detached background mode (stop/status/restart/logs). (#317, #318, #325, #341, + CLI UX follow-ups)
- **Agent Connections — live daemon observability + control**: A sidebar presence pill → popover → "View all" chat modal for watching and steering daemon agents, backed by a DB-backed, cross-instance `DaemonConnection` registry (self-reported clientType/host/version, generation-fenced liveness) and a persistent per-connection `DaemonExecution` state (running/queued, `execution:{connectionUuid}` SSE channel, deep links). Each session is a persistent conversation: every wake is a turn on a `DaemonSession` with live transcript relay (message-level pagination), continuation pinned to the origin connection. Humans can **inject free-text instructions** (origin-only precise delivery) and **interrupt / resume** a running run via a server→daemon reverse control channel (sticky interrupted status, two-stage process-tree kill). Ad-hoc conversations are first-class. Empty states carry a `npx @chorus-aidlc/chorus daemon` connect CTA. (#319, #320, #322–#327, #330–#337, #342, #343)
- **Verify Elaborate button wakes the daemon PM agent**: A human-clickable "Verify Elaborate" resolves an Idea's elaboration from the UI and wakes the assigned daemon PM agent to write the proposal — closing the Reversed Conversation loop. New user-side `elaboration_verified` wake, distinct from the unchanged agent-only `chorus_pm_validate_elaboration`. (#335)
- **Agent online presence in the @-mention dropdown**: Each agent candidate shows a green presence dot and a status line ("N active" / "Idle"), sourced from the daemon-connection registry, owner-scoped and batched. (#324)

### Changed
- **Daemon defaults to full-autonomy (yolo) mode**: The `chorus daemon` posture defaults to yolo with a prominent banner warning instead of an interactive confirmation; `--chorus-only` (or `CHORUS_CHORUS_ONLY=1`) reclaims the restricted `mcp__chorus__*`-only posture. (de5f4db)
- **README CLI & Daemon usage guide**: New Quick Start section documenting daemon setup (currently Claude Code only).

### Fixed
- **Dashboard idea panel out of sync on soft navigation**: Notification / SSE-toast / search / presence idea links changed the URL but never opened or switched the detail panel. Selection now derives from `useSearchParams()` with the SSR seed gated to first render, so deep-linking and closing a deep-linked panel both behave. (#340)
- **Lineage UI scroll/overflow defects**: Fixed the set-parent picker's non-scrolling candidate list and long-title overflow across picker rows, breadcrumb, and grid-item wrappers. (#339)
- **Daemon chat modal display**: Mobile now fills the viewport edge-to-edge (input pinned to bottom), and wide markdown blocks (tables/code/URLs) are contained instead of overflowing horizontally. (#336)

### Plugin
- **OpenClaw plugin → bidirectional daemon parity**: The OpenClaw plugin now implements the same bidirectional daemon protocol as the `chorus` CLI host, re-mapped to the in-process `runEmbeddedAgent` host — shared pure-REST daemon client, reverse control channel (interrupt/resume/deliver_turn), turn-advance + execution-state + streaming transcript reporting, real mid-run interrupt via AbortController, and pending-turns backfill. The real OpenClaw SDK surface is now typed. (#338)
- **All plugin packages → 0.11.0**: Lockstep bump across Claude Code (marketplace.json + plugin.json), Codex (plugin.json + `chorus-mcp-call.sh` clientInfo), OpenClaw (package.json), every skill `SKILL.md` on all four surfaces, and the standalone `public/skill/` distribution.

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Single-parent idea lineage**: Ideas now form a forest via an `Idea.parentUuid` self-relation. You can derive a child idea from a parent, reparent an existing idea (cycle-checked, same-project), and see a weak read-only "+N derived" rollup that never blocks either idea's elaboration / proposal / task flow. New `chorus_edit_idea` MCP tool (title / content / parentUuid, gated on `idea:write`) replaces the interim `set_idea_parent`; `chorus_pm_create_idea` gains `parentUuid`; `chorus_get_idea` / `chorus_get_ideas` expose lineage. REST adds `parentUuid` on idea-create and `PATCH /api/ideas/[uuid]/parent`. UI gains a tracker flat/lineage toggle with an indented blood-lineage view and an idea-detail Lineage section (parent breadcrumb, set-parent picker with descendant cycle-block, derived children). Human web edits and reparenting now record activity-timeline entries. DDL-only migration. (#307, #309)

### Changed
- **Dashboard is now the primary idea surface**: Unified the Overview tab's two segmented controls into one adaptive Ideas / Lineage / Stats 3-way switch with New Idea standalone, defaulting to the lineage view when a project has derivation and persisting manual choice per-project. The standalone Idea List page is removed — its RESTful URLs (`/projects/:p/ideas`, `/ideas/:ideaUuid`, `?idea=`) now 308-redirect into the Dashboard, the Ideas sidebar nav item is dropped, and internal idea links (search, notifications, stat cards) point straight at `/dashboard`. (#310, #311)
- **Idea Tracker header shows project identity**: The dashboard header now promotes the project name to the H1 and surfaces the project description as the subtitle (falling back to the generic subtitle when empty), with "Overview" demoted to a small eyebrow label. (#312)

### Fixed
- **Superadmin login on email collision**: When `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` matches a registered/default user (common in local dev), the login flow gave the superadmin no way in. `identify()` now returns a `multi_role` response on collision and the login page renders a role-picker routing each choice to its existing flow; `/login/admin` accepts an editable email in the up-front collision flow. Auth endpoints unchanged; i18n en + zh. (#306)
- **Lineage navigation in Overview**: Clicking a parent/child idea (or the post-derive child) in the Overview Lineage section changed the URL but kept the same idea rendered, because the query-only `router.push` fired no popstate. Lineage navigation now threads the parent's `openPanel`, behaving identically to a list-row click. (#313)

### Plugin
- **Claude Code & Codex plugins → 0.10.0, OpenClaw plugin → 0.10.0** (from 0.5.3): Lockstep bump for the idea-lineage feature. All four skill surfaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, standalone) updated with the derive / reparent / weak-rollup guidance and the `chorus_edit_idea` tool. (#307)

---

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Agent install guide in Settings key-creation dialog**: Creating an agent API key from Settings used to dead-end on the raw key with no setup guidance, while onboarding had a full 5-client install guide. The guide is extracted into a shared `AgentInstallGuide` component (single source of truth for both surfaces) and rendered inline in the create-key success state with the freshly created key embedded, so users can connect their agent right where they got the key. Onboarding refactored to consume the same component (behavior-preserving). (#295)

### Changed
- **Elaboration flow simplified — unified round generation, optional roundUuid, idea-level resolve**: `chorus_pm_start_elaboration` now generates any round (first, follow-up, or appended-after-resolution) and is callable both while elaborating and after the Idea is resolved; appended rounds set `isAppended=true` and keep the Idea resolved so an in-flight proposal is never re-blocked. `chorus_answer_elaboration`'s `roundUuid` is optional — auto-locates the single active (`pending_answers`) round. `chorus_pm_validate_elaboration` is re-scoped to a pure idea-level resolve action: takes only `ideaUuid` (no `roundUuid`), gated on `idea:admin`, requires human confirmation (except YOLO), with precondition "≥1 round and every round answered" — never mutates round status. A round's only active states are now `pending_answers → answered`; `validated`/`needs_followup` are legacy-only. New `ElaborationRound.isAppended` column (DDL-only migration); UI surfaces a "Follow-up" badge on appended round cards. Skills across all four surfaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, standalone) make the loop explicit: re-enter `start_elaboration` when answers derive new questions or the human raises a concern at the resolve gate; resolve only once the loop has settled. (#296, #297)
- **Task edit UI's acceptance-criteria editor aligned with Task Draft**: The real Task edit form previously rendered AC as a single legacy Markdown textarea while the Task Draft panel used a structured rows editor — the two surfaces had drifted apart. The structured AC editor is extracted into a shared controlled component so both panels render the same UI by construction. Real-task edits persist through the existing `replaceAcceptanceCriteria` service via a small extension to `updateTaskFieldsAction`. Client-side change detection ensures the destructive replace runs only when the criteria set actually changed, so verification marks survive non-AC edits. (#299)

### Plugin
- **Claude Code plugin → 0.9.4** and **Codex plugin → 0.9.4**: Lockstep version bump for the elaboration flow simplification. All four skill surfaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, standalone) updated with the explicit ask→answer loop guidance, `validate` reduced to ideaUuid-only, and the appended-round semantics. (#296, #297)
- **OpenClaw plugin → 0.5.3** (skills 0.9.4): Independent package version bump tracking the elaboration flow simplification. (#296)

---

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **Acceptance criteria now required on task create/edit**: A non-empty acceptance-criteria set is now an invariant of every task and task draft. A shared validator (`src/lib/acceptance-criteria.ts`) is the single source of truth for both the proposal service and the public MCP tool handlers. `chorus_pm_add_task_draft` / `chorus_create_tasks` reject missing or all-blank AC at creation (`create_tasks` is all-or-nothing — one bad task rejects the whole batch). `chorus_pm_update_task_draft` / `chorus_update_task` use partial semantics: AC provided must be non-empty (replaces existing), AC omitted is preserved — so status transitions and dependency edits keep working without resending AC. `chorus_update_task` gains an optional `acceptanceCriteriaItems` param with replace semantics. No schema/migration change; existing AC-less tasks are untouched until next edited. (#291)

### Plugin
- **Standalone skill surface aligned to 0.9.3**: The curl-installable `/skill/` distribution gains a `yolo-chorus` full-auto lifecycle skill plus `proposal-reviewer-chorus` and `task-reviewer-chorus` read-only adversarial reviewer skills (learning from the Codex plugin's skill-based reviewers). All reviewer references are unified to a framework-neutral "spawn a read-only sub-agent, load the reviewer skill, read its VERDICT comment" pattern instead of the Claude-Code-only `chorus:*-reviewer` agent types. Also registers the previously-unregistered `quick-dev-chorus` and `brainstorm-chorus` skills. (#293)
- **Codex plugin hook loading fixed**: The Codex plugin now uses plugin-bundled hooks instead of copied user hooks, refreshes its docs/skills for current hook support, and the installer offers to clean legacy Chorus hook entries. (#292)
- **Claude Code & Codex plugins → 0.9.3**: Version bump across marketplace.json, plugin.json, and all 9 skills to match. The "acceptance criteria required" guidance is synced across all four skill surfaces (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, standalone). OpenClaw intentionally stays on its own version sequence. (#291, #293)

---

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **`section` param on `chorus_get_proposal`**: New optional `section` enum (`basic` | `documents` | `tasks` | `full`), defaulting to `basic`. The default now returns proposal metadata plus a lightweight index of the drafts (uuid/type/title/contentLength for docs; uuid/title/priority/storyPoints/acceptanceCriteriaCount/dependsOnDraftUuids for tasks) with no heavy bodies, instead of the entire proposal on every call. Callers drill into `documents`/`tasks`/`full` on the same `proposalUuid` when they need content. Implemented as a pure `getProposalSection()` projection layered on the untouched `getProposal()`, so the REST route and frontend are unaffected. (#287)

### Fixed
- **@-mention popup not clickable inside modal dialogs**: The mention suggestion popup was appended to `document.body`, so when the editor was hosted inside a Radix Dialog (e.g. the proposal comments Sheet) it inherited `pointer-events:none` and could be selected by keyboard but not clicked — and clicking it dismissed the dialog. The popup now mounts inside the editor's own wrapper (a descendant of the dialog content), inheriting `pointer-events:auto` while `position:fixed` still escapes overflow clipping. (#289)
- **Long notification content clipped off-screen**: Notifications with very long project names, titles, or actor names overflowed the dropdown and were clipped invisible. Bound the ScrollArea viewport content column to the popup width and switched badge/title/action/actor lines to `break-words` so long content wraps instead of overflowing. (#288)

### Plugin
- **OpenClaw plugin rewritten for the OpenClaw 2026.4.27+ Plugin SDK** (→ 0.5.1): Replaces the legacy hand-wrapped-tools + HTTP-hook design with native MCP registration (`mutateConfigFile`), a `definePluginEntry` entry with `activation.onStartup`, SSE→agent wake via `runEmbeddedAgent`, reviewers converted from Claude-Code agent definitions into OpenClaw skills, an npm publish path shipping `src` + compiled `dist`, and 66 new unit tests. (#286)
- **Claude Code & Codex plugins → 0.9.1**: Patch bump tracking the `chorus_get_proposal` section work across all skill trees (proposal-reviewer → `section:full`, task-reviewer/develop → `section:documents`), plus the Codex `chorus-mcp-call.sh` clientInfo fix. (#287)

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **Real-time notifications for report creation**: Creating a Document with `type="report"` via `chorus_create_report` now emits SSE events (`document/created` + `idea/updated`) and records an idea-targeted Activity that fans out to bell-popup notifications for the Idea creator, assignee, and their human owners. Bell clicks deep-link to the dashboard's Idea panel. Side-effect steps in `document.service` are best-effort so emit failures cannot roll back the document insert. (#279)
- **`force` flag on `chorus_create_report`**: New optional `force: boolean` (default `false`) parameter. When omitted/false against a proposal that already has a report, the call returns an MCP error and writes nothing — closes a duplicate-report bug observed in `/yolo` runs where two independent paths (PostToolUse hook reminder + skill Phase 5b end-step) both fired against the same proposal. `force=true` preserves the prior multi-report semantics for explicit re-authoring. (#281)

### Fixed
- **IME composition lost text on Enter**: CJK / Japanese / Korean IME users were losing in-progress text when they pressed Enter to confirm a candidate word — the keystroke fired form submit / dialog close / search navigation instead. New shared `isImeComposing(e)` helper in `src/lib/ime.ts` (checks `nativeEvent.isComposing` + Safari `keyCode === 229` fallback) short-circuits 7 affected handlers across 6 files. CLAUDE.md gains a Frontend UI Rule so future Enter handlers route through the helper. (#280, #282)

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Idea-completion summary reports**: New `report` Document subtype captures the post-delivery summary of a finished Idea. New `chorus_create_report` MCP tool (gated on `document:write`) writes a Markdown summary as `Document(type="report")` under an approved proposal — service-side guard rejects writes to non-approved proposals. `chorus_get_idea` now returns `reports[]` (full Markdown content, sorted newest-first across the idea's approved+closed proposals); `chorus_get_ideas` adds a `reportCount` per row. UI surfaces a new Reports list under `IdeaDetailPanel` overview (hidden when zero reports exist). `/yolo` Phase 5b mandates a report at end-of-Idea; `/develop` advises one on the last task; a PostToolUse hook injects a one-line reminder when the verified task's proposal is fully done with no report yet. (#274)
- **Brainstorm skill (idea-stage elaboration prelude)**: Opt-in skill that runs a divergent-then-convergent dialogue and synthesizes the conversation into one ElaborationRound of decision-point Q&A. Solves the failure mode where idea-stage elaboration's structured multi-choice schema forced agents to fabricate options when an idea arrived in "still rephrasing" shape. Distributed to all four packages (Claude Code plugin, Codex plugin, public/skill/, OpenClaw plugin); per-package translation for OpenClaw to match its unprefixed tool surface. Pure producer — calls `start_elaboration` + `answer_elaboration` and returns; lifecycle decision (validate vs follow-up) stays in the idea skill. Zero backend / schema / UI changes. (#273)

### Changed (Breaking)
- **MCP tool surface trimmed (slice 1)**: Removed three redundant tool registrations to reduce same-shape ambiguity that hurts model tool selection. `chorus_pm_create_tasks` is dropped (use `chorus_create_tasks`); `chorus_add_task_dependency` and `chorus_remove_task_dependency` are dropped (use `chorus_update_task` with `addDependsOn` / `removeDependsOn`). Direct break — no deprecation step. Agent-facing surface goes from 80 → 77 tools. (#271)
- **Session lifecycle simplified to `{active, closed}`**: Dropped the `inactive` status and the unused `expiresAt` field on `AgentSession`. "Stale" is now a query-time predicate on `lastActiveAt` (cutoff: 1h). Default UI listings (Settings page per-agent sessions, project worker-avatar header) only show active+fresh sessions; MCP-facing reads (`chorus_list_sessions`, `chorus_get_session`) and Activity-stream lookups remain unfiltered so plugin reuse and audit-trail navigation continue to see everything. Every session-touching MCP tool now refreshes `lastActiveAt` as a side effect of success — plugins no longer need standalone heartbeats during normal operation. The standalone `chorus_session_heartbeat` is retained for explicit keep-alives. The `expiresAt` parameter on `chorus_create_session` is removed. (#272)

### Plugin
- **Claude Code plugin → 0.9.0** and **Codex plugin → 0.9.0**: Lockstep version bump for the slice-1 tool removal and session lifecycle work. Reviewer subagent `maxTurns` raised 40/50 → 100 (Claude Code only — Codex has no equivalent frontmatter) so a single review pass can finish without retries. (#275, #271)
- **Standalone skill → 0.3.1**: Independent bump tracking the slice-1 tool removal docs sweep. (#271)

---

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Cascade-migrate Idea on cross-project move**: `chorus_move_idea` now walks the full AI-DLC pipeline tail in one Prisma transaction — moves the Idea plus all linked Proposals (any status), all materialized Documents and Tasks, and all related Activities — instead of leaving approved-proposal artifacts stranded in the source project. Adds a Move button + dialog with a dry-run preview to the Idea detail panel, and a new `GET /api/ideas/[uuid]/move/preview` endpoint. (#268)
- **Mermaid diagrams in Markdown content**: `mermaid` code blocks now render as diagrams in Documents, Proposals, Ideas, Tasks, and Comments via `@streamdown/mermaid`. Collapses the 14 direct `<Streamdown>` call sites onto a single `MarkdownContent` component. (#266)
- **Delete Document from the dashboard**: New destructive Delete button in the Document detail action bar, backed by a Server Action that reuses `documentService.deleteDocument`. Agents continue to use `chorus_admin_delete_document` via MCP. Also drops the redundant Back button (the breadcrumb already covers it). (#264)

### Fixed
- **Long elaboration option labels truncated**: The shadcn Button ancestor forced `whitespace-nowrap`, so long option labels and unbreakable URLs clipped. Apply `whitespace-normal` + `overflow-wrap:anywhere` and pin the indicator to the top of multi-line content. Also adds an inline ✓ confirm button (and Enter binding) to the Other free-text input, suppressed on the last question to avoid accidental round submission. (#265)

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **Agent picker dropped non-developer agents**: Task/Idea assign modals filtered agents by the legacy `roles[]` array, so admin-preset and custom-permission agents disappeared from the picker. Replaced with an effective-permission lookup — `getAssignableAgents` now filters by `task:write` / `idea:write` computed from preset + custom bits, and `chorus_pm_assign_task` gates the assignee on the same effective permission. (#259)

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **OpenSpec-aware mode (Claude Code only for now)**: Auto-activates when both an `openspec/` directory and the `openspec` CLI are present. Adds a dedicated `openspec-aware` skill in the Claude Code plugin, `/opsx/{explore,propose,apply,archive}` slash commands, four `openspec-*` skills under `.claude/skills/`, an `archive-trigger` spec, and `docs/OPENSPEC_MODE.md`. Includes a `PostToolUse` archive-trigger hook (`on-post-verify-task.sh`) that fires after task verification. (#245)

### Changed
- **`my_assignments` aligned with checkin.ideaTracker**: Extracted a shared `idea-tracker.service.ts` so `chorus_get_my_assignments` and `chorus_checkin` return the same project-grouped idea-tracker shape (derived status + proposal/task counts), replacing the divergent legacy assignments aggregation. (#244)
- **Docs sweep**: Aligned README, ARCHITECTURE, MCP_TOOLS, and PRD with the 0.7.0 permission model and the stateless MCP endpoint. (#254)

### Fixed
- **PGlite cross-handler race**: Pin pg.Pool to `max=1` in PGlite mode so concurrent Next.js route handlers can't race the same connection through PGlite's single-writer engine. (#252)
- **Windows tarball runnable**: Reworked `chorus.mjs` and added `scripts/prepack-pglite.mjs` so the published npm tarball runs cleanly on Windows. (#251)

### Plugin
- **Claude Code plugin → 0.8.3**: OpenSpec-aware mode and reviewer `maxTurns` doubled. (#245, #249)
- **Codex plugin → 0.8.3**: Cross-port maintenance only (no OpenSpec mode yet).

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **OpenCode client install guide**: New OpenCode tab in the in-app Install Guide with a 3-step one-shot flow covering env setup, `install-opencode.sh` installer (idempotent JSON merge into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, Bash 3.2 compatible, backup on write), and verify. Adds `docs/CONNECT_OPENCODE` (en + zh) and mirrors the new frame in `docs/design.pen`. (#242)

### Changed
- **Docs aligned with fine-grained agent permissions**: Sweep of README / CLAUDE.md / ARCHITECTURE / AUTH / CONNECT_* to replace references to the legacy `admin/pm/developer` role model with the 5×3 permission matrix shipped in 0.7.0. New `docs/PERMISSIONS.md` as the dedicated permission-model reference. (#241)

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Fine-grained agent permissions**: Replaces the 3-role agent model (admin/pm/developer) with a permission matrix of 5 resources × 3 actions = 15 bits, exposed in the UI as role presets plus a Custom option that freely combines bits. Introduces authz types/presets/permissions library with effective-set computation, wires REST + MCP servers to gate on `Permission[]`, and migrates the Agent/ApiKey schema with a new `permissions` column. Settings create/edit and onboarding share an `AgentPermissionPicker` grid. (#232)

### Changed
- **Checkin response shape**: Returns a resource-aggregated permission object for token-efficient consumption by skills and plugin hooks. (#232)
- **Legacy role aliases rejected at API boundary**: `POST /api/agents` no longer accepts the legacy `pm`/`developer`/`admin` role strings; they now return 422. (#232)
- **Proposal reject/revoke authorization**: `pm_reject_proposal` / `pm_revoke_proposal` gate on `hasPermission(..., "proposal:admin")` instead of ad-hoc role-string checks. Authors can always act on their own proposals. (#232)

### Fixed
- **Settings edit preset derivation**: An agent with `roles=[pm_agent]` plus extra `task:admin` was previously read as preset mode and silently zeroed on save. Now correctly accounts for custom permissions layered on top of a preset. (#232)
- **Claim routes gated on the wrong identity**: `/api/ideas|tasks/[uuid]/claim` now look up the selected agent by UUID and gate on `idea:write` / `task:write`, instead of the legacy pm/developer role strings (which matched zero 0.7.0 agents). (#232)

### Plugin
- **Claude Code plugin → 0.8.0**: Prereq checks switched to permission-based gating. `chorus/SKILL.md` adds a Permissions section and Tool-Access-by-Preset table; `proposal`, `quick-dev`, `yolo`, and `develop` skills updated to reference resource permissions instead of role labels. (#232)
- **Codex plugin → 0.8.0**: Ported all 0.7.0 permission-model updates to `plugins/chorus/` — bumped plugin + every skill (including the two reviewer skills) + the hardcoded `clientInfo` version in `chorus-mcp-call.sh`. Cleaned up stale role-label language in `yolo`/`develop`. Fixed `chorus_create_session` being called with a non-existent `roles` arg. (#233)
- **plugin-maintenance skill → 0.2.0**: Future plugin changes must bump both packages + the `clientInfo` string, and preserve intentional differences (stateless hooks, `$`-prefixed skills, TOML config) when porting content between the two plugins. (#233)

---

## [0.6.7] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Codex CLI plugin**: Ported Chorus plugin to Codex CLI under `plugins/chorus/` alongside the existing Claude Code plugin. Includes marketplace manifest, 7 workflow skills (chorus/idea/proposal/develop/review/quick-dev/yolo), 2 reviewer skills, hooks wiring (SessionStart + PostToolUse), one-shot installer `install-codex.sh` with idempotent `~/.codex/config.toml` setup, and 17-assertion regression test. (#222)
- **Workspace picker for multi-company email**: When a user's email resolves to 2+ Companies (via emailDomains ∪ User.email), `/login/pick-workspace` lets them choose which workspace to sign in to. New `GET /api/auth/company-oidc` endpoint, email-gated to block UUID enumeration. (#227)
- **Codex onboarding tab + per-client connect guides**: In-app Install Guide adds a Codex tab between Claude Code and OpenClaw with a 3-step one-shot installer flow. New `docs/CONNECT_CLAUDE_CODE`, `CONNECT_CODEX`, `CONNECT_OTHER_AGENTS` (en + zh) walk through each connection path end-to-end. README points at the setup wizard + per-client guide table. (#224)

### Changed
- **Email domain uniqueness**: Dropped SuperAdmin-side email-domain-uniqueness validation — the same domain can now be attached to multiple Companies (required for the workspace picker). (#227)
- **Logout**: No longer calls `manager.signoutRedirect` — clearing the local session is sufficient, IdP SSO session stays intact for silent re-login. (#227)

---

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **npm one-click install**: `@chorus-aidlc/chorus` now works reliably via `npx` / `npm install` on all platforms (macOS ARM64, Linux, Windows) — replaced `bcrypt` (native C++ bindings) with pure-JS `bcryptjs`, eliminating the last cross-platform blocker. (#192)
- **Document export (MD/PDF/Word)**: Export documents in three formats — Markdown with YAML frontmatter, PDF via remark-pdf with bundled CJK/symbol/emoji fonts, and Word via remark-docx with syntax-highlighted code blocks. Mermaid diagrams rendered as PNG. Available on document detail, document list, and proposal editor pages. (#199)
- **Proposal revoke**: Admin operation to undo proposal approval — resets status to draft, cascade-closes materialized tasks, deletes materialized documents. Frontend dialog with impact preview. (#197)
- **Unified PM reject/revoke tools**: Moved `chorus_admin_reject_proposal` and `chorus_admin_revoke_proposal` into PM tools (`chorus_pm_reject_proposal`, `chorus_pm_revoke_proposal`). PM agents can only reject/revoke own proposals; admin agents bypass ownership guard. (#202)
- **Checkin API refactor**: New `checkin.service.ts` replaces bloated assignments response with project-grouped idea tracker (derived status, proposal/task counts) and 5-item notification summary. Agent-centric 3+1 query batch eliminates per-project N+1. (#203)
- **Onboarding flow improvements**: Back navigation for Copy Key / Install Guide / Test Connection steps, removed 5-minute timeout (SSE listens indefinitely), copyable checkin prompt in waiting state. Agent checkin now emits SSE-only (no DB notification row). (#205)
- **Post-completion reviewer reminder**: Inject review+verify reminder into SubagentStart workflow so subagents include it in their final response. Reviewer agents (proposal-reviewer, task-reviewer) are skipped. (#206)

### Changed
- **Unified 24h datetime display**: Replace all `toLocaleDateString()` with shared `formatDateTime` utility (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm) across all pages and exports. Server Components use client-side `FormattedDateTime` for local timezone. (#200)

### Fixed
- **Duplicate notifications in multi-container**: EventBus Redis relay now tags re-emitted events with `_remote: true` so notification-listener skips DB writes on non-originating instances. (#204)
- **Proposal revoke skips closed tasks**: Filter already-closed tasks during revoke to avoid stale resource accumulation. (#198)

### Plugin
- **Review skill**: Added shared Review Strategy section and task-reviewer verification step (B2.5). (#201)
- **on-subagent-start.sh**: Post-completion block injected into workflow; on-subagent-stop.sh trimmed to side-effects only. (#206)
- **on-session-start.sh**: Slimmed ~60 lines of redundant static docs, replaced with compact Quick Reference. (#203)

---

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **PGlite stale connection auto-retry**: Add Prisma `$extends` middleware to auto-retry queries (up to 3 attempts) when PGlite silently drops idle connections during heavy transactions. Matches both P1017 and "Connection terminated" errors. (#190)
- **PGlite idle connection eviction**: Add `pool.on("error")` handler to silently evict broken connections instead of crashing the process.

### Changed
- **README**: Add PGlite concurrency note (en/zh) recommending external PostgreSQL or Docker Compose for multi-agent use.

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **CLI entry and npm publishing**: Added `chorus.mjs` CLI entry point with embedded PGlite support, `--port`, `--data-dir`, `--pglite-port` flags, auto-migration, and graceful shutdown. Enables `npx @chorus-aidlc/chorus` one-command startup. (#185)

### Fixed
- **Proposal approval transaction timeout**: Batch all materialization into 5 SQL calls max (was ~29) using `createManyAndReturn`. Propagates transaction client into child functions. Fixes PGlite and docker-local timeout on proposals with many tasks/docs. (#187)
- **Dashboard PGlite connection exhaustion**: Serialize dashboard data queries to avoid exceeding PGlite's max-connections limit, which caused "Server has closed the connection" errors.
- **Plugin MCP tool compatibility**: Fixed plugin MCP tool to work with stateless MCP servers. (#183)

### Changed
- **README**: Simplified README — removed redundant sections, added What's New. (#181)

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-17

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Default port changed from 3000 to 8637**: To avoid conflicts with commonly used port 3000 (e.g., React, Next.js dev servers), Chorus now uses a unique default port. All documentation, Docker configs, CDK, and plugin scripts updated. Existing deployments must update port mappings and environment variables.

### Added
- **Embedded PGlite mode**: Zero-dependency deployment option using embedded PostgreSQL (PGlite), eliminating the need for an external database server. (#162)
- **Structured logging with Pino**: Replaced console.log with structured JSON logging via Pino for better observability. (#168)
- **MCP tool call logging**: All MCP tool calls are now logged, including business-level rejections. (#169)

### Changed
- **Stateless MCP route**: MCP endpoint no longer maintains in-memory session state — each request creates a fresh transport+server, enabling horizontal scaling without sticky sessions. (#176)

### Fixed
- **Progress bar completion count**: Closed tasks are now included in project progress bar calculations. (#120, #171)
- **OIDC login unique constraint**: Resolved `oidcSub` unique constraint violation during default login flow. (#164)
- **Task reassignment**: Allow reassigning tasks that are already assigned to another user/agent. (#12)

### Docs
- Added search technical design document and architecture reference. (#51)

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Multi-project Filtering**: Filter by multiple projects via MCP headers. (#37)
- **Team Lead Verify Reminders**: Auto-remind team leads to verify completed tasks via plugin hooks. (#44)

### Changed

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Proposal-based Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by source proposal across UI, API, MCP tools, and plugins. (#34)
- **Idea Reuse Across Proposals**: An Idea can now be linked to multiple Proposals, enabling iterative refinement. (#29)
- **Delete Proposal Button**: Added frontend button to delete proposals directly from the UI. (#27)
- **Simplified Proposal MCP**: Empty shell proposal creation + relaxed E1 validation for faster PM workflows. (#25)
- **PR Workflow Skill**: New `pr-workflow` skill for branch/PR/CI/merge workflow automation. (#33)
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Added Vitest test suite — Phase 1 (417 tests), Phase 2 (736 tests, 71.5%), Phase 3 (984 tests, 95.3%). (#21, #22, #23)
- **Coverage Badge**: README now displays dynamic test coverage badge via shields.io. (#24)

### Changed
- **OpenClaw Plugin Config**: All config params are now optional with missing-config warnings instead of hard errors. (#31)

### Fixed

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Structured Acceptance Criteria**: Dual-track verification system — developer self-check + admin verification per criterion. New `AcceptanceCriterion` Prisma model as independent table, with `chorus_report_criteria_self_check` and `chorus_mark_acceptance_criteria` MCP tools. Kanban cards show acceptance progress badges, task detail panel displays criterion cards with pass/fail actions. Full i18n support. (#18)
- **Task Dependency Enforcement**: Tasks cannot move to `in_progress` when their dependencies are unresolved. Kanban UI shows lock icon + blocked banner with force-move confirmation dialog for admins. New `checkDependenciesResolved()` service method with enriched blocker info. `chorus_admin_reopen_task` gains `force` parameter for admin bypass. (#16)
- **`COOKIE_SECURE` Environment Variable**: Support `COOKIE_SECURE=false` for HTTP-only deployments. Extracted `getCookieOptions()` helper to eliminate 8 duplicate cookie config blocks. Updated Docker Compose and documentation. (#19)

### Changed
- **Session Management Simplified**: Removed manual session lifecycle management from skill docs. Plugin sessions are fully automated by hooks; standalone skill removes session tools entirely.
- **Unblocked Tasks Rule**: `getUnblockedTasks` now requires dependencies to be `done` or `closed` (previously accepted `to_verify`).

### Fixed
- **Code Block Horizontal Scroll**: Fixed horizontal scroll for code blocks in task draft detail panel by overriding ScrollArea's `display:table` to `display:block`.

### Plugin
- Chorus Plugin bumped to v0.2.1 (session docs clarification, dependency enforcement, acceptance criteria).
- OpenClaw Plugin bumped to v0.2.1: new `admin-tools.ts` module with `chorus_admin_create_project_group` and `chorus_mark_acceptance_criteria`; added `chorus_get_project_groups` / `chorus_get_project_group` to common tools; event router handles `task_verified` / `task_reopened`. (#20)

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-06

- **RESTful Panel URLs**: Ideas and Tasks side panels now have shareable RESTful URLs for direct linking.
- **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Comments now render code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- **Mobile Responsive Layout**: All dashboard pages are now mobile-friendly with responsive design.
- **Sessionless Pixel Workers**: Agents without active sessions now appear as pixel workers on PixelCanvas.
- **OpenClaw `assign_task` Tool**: Added `assign_task` tool and `reviewNote` approval support to the OpenClaw plugin.

### Changed
- **Chorus Repositioned as Agent Harness**: Updated documentation to reposition Chorus as an Agent Harness platform.

- **Edit Agent Modal**: Edit agent name, persona, and system prompt directly from the settings page.
- **Agent Owner Awareness**: Agents are linked to their human owner, enabling owner-scoped `@mention` workflow and new `search_mentionables` MCP tool.
- **@Mention Defaults to Own Agents**: `@mention` dropdown defaults to the current user's own agents for faster tagging.
- **Real-time Comment Updates**: SSE-powered live comment sync for Idea, Task & Proposal detail panels.

### Changed

- **`create_idea` Permission Level**: Moved from Admin-only to PM permission level, allowing PM agents to create ideas directly.

### Fixed

- **Notification Scoping**: Elaboration and task_verify notifications are now scoped to relevant parties instead of broadcasting to all admin agents.
- **Duplicate Event Emission**: Removed duplicate `eventBus.emit` in elaboration service.
- **Missing Activity Events**: Added activity events for idea assign and proposal actions triggered from the UI.
- **Event Router ProjectUuid**: Include `projectUuid` in all event-router trigger messages for proper SSE routing.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Proposal Validation Checklist**: Pre-submission validation with 12 checks (5 errors, 5 warnings, 2 info) across document completeness, task quality, and DAG structure. New `chorus_pm_validate_proposal` MCP tool for PM agents. Collapsible frontend checklist with error/warning count badges and full i18n support (ICU plurals).
- **`chorus_list_projects` MCP tool**: List all projects regardless of project group — available to all authenticated agents.
- **`ungroupedCount` in project groups**: `chorus_get_project_groups` now returns the count of ungrouped projects.
- **Plugin Bash 3.2 compatibility**: Fixed `${VAR,,}` Bash 4+ syntax in hook scripts for macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2 compatibility. Added `test-syntax.sh` script to verify plugin hook compatibility.

### Fixed

- **Project group completion rate always showing 0%**: `getGroupStats` was hardcoding `completedTasks: 0` instead of summing from each project. Group dashboard also now counts both "done" and "closed" tasks.
- **Tasks page performance storm**: Batch DB queries reduce ~82 queries to ~4 for task listing. Added `batchGetActorNames()`, `batchFormatCreatedBy()`, `formatTaskResponsesBatch()`, and `batchGetWorkerCountsForTasks()`. SSE throttled to 3s + 1s debounce to limit `router.refresh()` during active agent work.

### Plugin

- Bumped Chorus Plugin from v0.1.7 to v0.1.9.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-26

First public release of Chorus — an AI Agent & Human collaboration platform implementing the [AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Lifecycle)](docs/PRD_Chorus.md) methodology.

**Core philosophy: "Reversed Conversation" — AI proposes, humans verify.**

### Zero Context Injection

Agents automatically know "who I am" and "what to do" — no manual onboarding.

- Agent persona with predefined role, expertise, and work style
- `chorus_checkin` returns pending assignments, project context, and notifications
- Chorus Plugin for Claude Code auto-injects session context on sub-agent spawn
- Downloadable Skill documentation for agent self-onboarding

### AI-DLC Workflow

Complete closed-loop pipeline from idea to delivery:

```
Idea → Elaboration → Proposal → [Document + Task DAG] → Execute → Verify → Done
```

- **Ideas**: Capture requirements, assign to PM agents or humans
- **Requirements Elaboration**: Structured multi-round Q&A with stakeholders before proposal creation
- **Proposals**: PM Agent drafts PRD + task breakdown → human reviews → approve/reject/close
- **Documents**: PRD, tech design, ADR, spec, guide — versioned Markdown with proposal linkage
- **Task DAG**: Directed acyclic graph with dependency management, cycle detection, and topological ordering
- **Task Lifecycle**: open → assigned → in_progress → to_verify → done with optimistic locking on claim/release
- **Agent Hours**: New effort metric replacing traditional story points — 1 AH = 1 Agent working for 1 hour

### Multi-Agent Awareness

All agent work is visible in real-time — no more isolated sessions.

- **Agent Sessions**: Track sub-agent swarm activity with checkin/checkout, heartbeat, and auto-expiry
- **Activity Stream**: Audit log of all actions with session attribution for full traceability
- **SSE Real-time Updates**: Live Kanban, Ideas, and Proposals sync across all connected clients
- **Pixel Art Workers**: Animated typing indicators on Kanban cards showing which agents are actively working
- **@Mentions**: Tag users and agents in comments with notification delivery
- **Work Reports**: Progress updates stored as comments for team-wide visibility

### Web UI

- Project dashboard with grouped projects, completion rates, and aggregated stats
- Kanban board with drag-and-drop task management
- Interactive DAG visualization ([@xyflow/react](https://reactflow.dev/) + dagre)
- Proposal detail with document/task draft review workflow
- Rich Markdown rendering in Ideas, Tasks, and Proposals
- Full i18n support (English and Chinese)

### MCP Server

40+ tools across three agent roles via HTTP Streamable Transport:

| Role | Tools | Responsibility |
|------|-------|---------------|
| PM Agent | `chorus_pm_*` | Analyze ideas, create proposals, manage documents, assign tasks |
| Developer Agent | `chorus_*_task`, `chorus_report_work` | Claim tasks, report progress, submit for verification |
| Admin Agent | `chorus_admin_*` | Create projects/ideas, approve proposals, verify tasks |

Compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Kiro, and any MCP client.

### Auth

- OIDC authentication for human users
- API Key authentication (`cho_` prefix, SHA-256 hashed) for agents
- Default username/password auth mode for quick setup
- Multi-tenant company isolation

### Deployment

- Docker image with standalone Next.js build (multi-arch: amd64/arm64)
- Docker Compose full-stack setup (app + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- AWS CDK infrastructure-as-code package
- `.env.example` for all required configuration
